# GITHUBtask-marveltask-3-
Github task from Marvel


GitHub is a platform that helps developers store, manage, and share their code. To complete this task, I learned how to use various GitHub actions. The goal was to fix an issue in the main file, and here's how I did it:

1. Forked the repository to have my own copy.
2. Created a new branch to work on the changes.
3. Fixed the error by removing the ‘+1’ from the code.
4. Committed the changes to save them.
5. Finally, created a pull request to suggest my changes to the original repository.
